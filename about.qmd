## Background

I'm a BYU student focused on business, technology, and building real products. My interests span AI, operations, and entrepreneurship—particularly building tools that enhance productivity and decision-making.

I'm developing my portfolio by shipping prototypes and documenting problems I'm exploring. I'm committed to improving my skills in transforming concepts into functional, value-creating products.
